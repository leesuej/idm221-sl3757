# About Me
## Creative, strategic, adaptable

Hi, I’m Susanna, a dedicated student and aspiring social media manager with a passion for creating impactful digital campaigns. As a communications student with a focus in public relations and a minor in UX/UI at Drexel University, I’ve gained hands-on experience managing platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, and Pinterest, where I focus on growing engagement and enhancing online visibility. I specialize in developing tailored organic and paid campaigns that resonate with diverse audiences and drive measurable results.

I constantly explore new tools and insights to optimize strategies and adapt to the ever-evolving world of social media. Whether it’s building an online presence or creating compelling content, I’m driven by the challenge of finding innovative ways to engage with and inspire audiences.

I’m always leveraging data-driven insights to optimize strategies and stay ahead of the latest trends in social media. Whether I’m building an online presence or crafting engaging content, I’m excited to explore new ways to connect with audiences.
